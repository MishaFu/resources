Problem 1: 
So I got a segmentation fault in file test_game1 on line 252 when running it with input and output files.
The segfault is due to a null pointer.
Specifically, invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol], is null. 
On line 249, invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol] is allocated as following:
invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] = new Warrior();

However, it should be invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol] instead of two rows. 

Problem 2:
I got a wrong result due to line 27, there is a semicolon at the end.
if (protector->weapon == weapon_axe && invader->weapon == weapon_sword);
I deleted it, so it won't run unconditionally

Problem 3:
